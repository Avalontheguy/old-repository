Commentary: This computer is not my main computer, it's my moms, my personal computer had the WASD key fall off due to "overuseage" so my mom lended me hers.
Problems: I haven't used this computer that much so I have'nt seen any problems, but due to my mom's collasal amount of saving pictures and files the storage has very little room to spare. This could cause problems if I ever need to download big projects. When the battery runs low it reacts like my personal computer and lowers the brightness along with limiting some functions such as acsessing the cloud or running a little slow when many things are on the screen.
